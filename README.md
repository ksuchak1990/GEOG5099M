# GEOG5099M - Data Analytics and Society Dissertation

This is a repository to store the work that I do on my Masters dissertation.
The dissertation is worth 30 credits (out of a total of 180 credits for the
Masters).

The aim of this project will be to implement an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
with a 2D Agent-Based Model (ABM); depending on how things go, there is
potential to implement other Data Assimilation (DA) methods with the same ABM
with a view to comparing their performance.

## To-Do

* Construct outline for literature review
* Build prototype EnKF

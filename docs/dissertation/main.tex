\chapter*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is data assimilation?
    \item What is the Ensemble Kalman Filter?
    \item What are Agent-Based Models?
    \item How do people model pedestrians?
    \item EnKF: options for generating observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item External (the old way):
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item observations come from a previous run of the model
                    \item therefore, they are independent
                    \item the problem here is that the ensemble members probably
                        have been set with the wrong entrances and exits for
                        agents
                    \item this is likely more realistic, ie when modelling
                        people we ultimately won't know where they intend to go
                    \item but I don't think that we can overcome this without
                        parameter estimation DA.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Internal (the new way):
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item observations come from the \texttt{base\_model}
                    \item all ensemble members are deep copies of the
                        \texttt{base\_model}
                    \item consequently, they have the same parameters and
                        initial conditions
                    \item the problem with this is that is not realistic
                    \item but we're going to do it anyway (for now)
                \end{itemize}

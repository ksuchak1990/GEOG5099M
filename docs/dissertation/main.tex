One of the most prevalent methods by which we can simulate the movement of
pedestrians around urban environments is agent-based modelling.
This technique models at the microscopic level, representing each pedestrian as
an individual agent with interactions between agents (and between agents and
their environment) resulting in the emergence of macroscopic system behaviour.
However, such interactions often induce some degree of randomness resulting in
the models diverging from the real state of the system.
As a result, agent-based models are predominantly used to simulate offline
scenarios.

With the advent of big data, however, there has been a growing interest in
leveraging the available data to simulate social systems in real-time.
To achieve this, new methods need to be developed to combine observations with
model states; one such method that exists in the field of numerical weather
prediction is data assimilation.
Relatively little work has been undertaken so far that makes use of data
assimilation methods in conjunction with pedestrian agent-based models.
This investigation, therefore, presents a preliminary experiment to demonstrate
that the Ensemble Kalman Filter method of data assimilation can be implemented
in conjunction with an agent-based model of pedestrian movement and furthermore
can improve the accuracy with which such a model simulates a system.

By inspecting the effect of the Ensemble Kalman Filter on the state of
individual agents, it is seen that the data assimilation technique successfully
increases the accuracy of the simulation.
Furthermore, in some cases, it is found that the model in conjunction with the
Ensemble Kalman Filter is more accurate than the observations used for
assimilation.
The work is limited in its scope, with only a single set of model and filter
parameters being used.
Future work should, therefore, seek to explore the parameter space and its
impact on filter performance.

%\chapter*{Notes}

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item What is data assimilation?
    %\item What is the Ensemble Kalman Filter?
    %\item What are Agent-Based Models?
    %\item How do people model pedestrians?
    %\item What happens when an agent in one of the ensemble member models tries
        %to leave the station early? Because we're only doing state estimation
        %(meaning just the agent coordinates), the agent won't get reactivated.
    %\item Errors should converge on something relating to twice the exit
        %distance.
    %\item Signposting at the beginning of each chapter
    %\item Don't need to review calibration too much
    %\item Don't need to talk about different types of enkf's too much
    %\item Don't need to talk about DA with CA too much
%\end{itemize}

%\chapter*{Notes}

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item What is data assimilation?
    %\item What is the Ensemble Kalman Filter?
    %\item What are Agent-Based Models?
    %\item How do people model pedestrians?
    %\item What happens when an agent in one of the ensemble member models tries
        %to leave the station early? Because we're only doing state estimation
        %(meaning just the agent coordinates), the agent won't get reactivated.
    %\item Errors should converge on something relating to twice the exit
        %distance.
    %\item Signposting at the beginning of each chapter
    %\item Don't need to review calibration too much
    %\item Don't need to talk about different types of enkf's too much
    %\item Don't need to talk about DA with CA too much
%\end{itemize}

%\section*{Structure}

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item What is the problem?
    %\item Why should people care?
    %\item What has been done in the past to try to solve the problem?
    %\item What are we doing to solve the problem? How is this different?
    %\item How well does our attempt work? How does this compare to others?

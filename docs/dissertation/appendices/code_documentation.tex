This is where I explain the design choices for how the enkf was coded.

\begin{itemize}
    \item options for generating observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item external
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item observations come from a previous model run as
                    synthetic data
                    \item therefore they should be independent
                    \item the problem here is that the ensemble members probably
                    have been set with the wrong entrances and exits or agents
                    \item this is likely more realistic, because when modelling
                    people we ultimately won't know where they intend to go
                    \item but we may be able to overcome this using parameter
                    estimation DA.
                \end{itemize}
            \item internal
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item observations come from the \texttt{base\_model}
                    \item all ensemble members are deep copies of the
                    \texttt{base\_model}
                    \item consequently, they have the same parameters and
                    initial conditions
                    \item problem here is that it's not very realistic
                    \item but we're going with it for this particular version
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
